# Helion

A modern fast paced FPS engine.


## Build Instructions

### Windows

If using **Visual Studio 2022+** or **Rider**, press Run and it will do everything.


### Linux

This assumes Ubuntu for installing packages.

```sh
sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-7.0 libfluidsynth-dev libopenal-dev
```

If you have an IDE that supports C# (like Rider), you can open Helion and build/run directly.

To make a release build:

```sh
Scripts/build.sh
```

### Mac

None of the developers have a Mac to test. 

You likely can follow the Linux instructions to build.
